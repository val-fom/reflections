Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I'm waking on different computers, in team and/or want to share my code with somebody

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because while I'm working in my project I want to know what exactly is going on with it

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
	 one instead of another?

A: Forks are placed on GitHub only. Clone can be like a copy of remote repository on
	 local machine, a both on local. Branches is a label used to mark some commits for
	 different experimets or developing some new features.

A: It is good to know where is head of our branch ahead or behind relatively to remote origin

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
	 and what would be harder?

A: I'll use shared or cloud directory. Or simply use an email)
	 May be it would be not as complicated at the beginnig as Git, 
	 but if you know how to use Git and GitHub collaborating would be more efective 

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
 	 What benefits does each approach have?

A: When I collaborate to make a pull request I need to do my changes in separate branch.
	 And common advantage is, like it was said before, using branches i can simply switch between
	 different tasks, features, experimental changes.
